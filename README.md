Binary Search Trees 

Objective: 
The objectives of this assignment are to provide you with more practice on the use of the various C++ concepts/constructs introduced in the lectures so far, including classes, dynamic memory allocation, pointers, I/O, and dynamic data structures. This will be done in the context of implementing a binary search tree class.
